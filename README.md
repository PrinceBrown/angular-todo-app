#Angular Todo App with JSON-Server Backend
-------------------------------------------

This is a simple Todo application built using Angular framework and JSON-Server as the backend. The app allows users to create, update, and delete tasks in a to-do list.

To run the application, follow the steps below:

1.  Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
2.  Clone the repository or download the source code.
3.  Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4.  Install the required dependencies by running the command `npm install`.
5.  Start the JSON-Server backend by running the command `npm server`.
6.  Open another terminal window and navigate to the project directory.
7.  Start the Angular development server by running the command `ng serve`.
8.  Open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:4200` to access the application.

The Angular Todo App communicates with the JSON-Server backend to fetch and persist data. The JSON-Server is a lightweight server that utilizes a JSON file as a data store. By default, the server runs on `http://localhost:3000` and provides a RESTful API for CRUD operations on the Todo list.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to customize the application according to your needs
